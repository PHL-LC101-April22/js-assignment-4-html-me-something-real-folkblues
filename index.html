      <p>A few years ago when I was interviewing for a job I sat down with a director the department I was applying for. I sat quietly as he read my resume. After a few moments, he asks, "You're resume is very interesting. How exactly did you come to to apply for this position?"</p>
      <p>Needless to say my career path has been non-linear at best. This used to give me a lot of anxiety, as I thought it was a sign I was undisciplined or did not possess what it takes to succeed in a more corporate environment. But as I formulated my response to the director's question, I thought about everything I have learned and the wisdom I gained, and I believed it was these things that set me apart as a good candidate for the role. (I did get the job in the end)</p>
      <p>I attained a Bachelor's in Asian Studies, with my studies mostly focusing on East Asia and the Japanese language. I even had the privilege of studying abroad in Japan for a year. Foreign languages are my first and primary passion. My Army brat upbringing most likely has something to do with that, as was my parents' penchant for travel when I was a young girl.</p>
      <p>I worked various retail and service industry jobs, including managing a bustling cafe in the financial district of Atlanta for a while. I then landed a job as a Japanese conversational coach for a virtual public school for one of the southern states. It was at this time that I decided to move to Philly, simply because I needed a change in scenery (Army brat never left me).</p>
      <p>After a year of working part time retail and for the virtual public school, I decided to search for a position which would utilize my language skills (Spanish and Japanese). I found a technical Helpdesk position where I was able to take calls and trouble shoot complex equipment/systems used for clinical drug trials from all over the world. It was an exciting role and I succeeded in becoming the subject matter expert in a couple of the products and systems. By the third year I wanted to move outside of the helpdesk role and into a project management one, and that's when I interviewed at the job at the beginning of my story.</p>
      <p>It has been years since that interview, and I have moved two companies since. I am now an SME in the electronic implementation of clinical outcome assessments for drug trials across various therapeutic indications on several types of devices/systems, and how it impacts data integrity. I am highly motivated by my work and because a large part of it requires working with front-end developers, over time I began to take an interest in coding and decided to enroll in LC101</p>
